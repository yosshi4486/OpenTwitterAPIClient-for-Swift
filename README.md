# OpenTwitterAPIClient-for-swift

This is autogenerated Twitter v2 API client for swift.ã€€ The code is generated by using an OSS ["openapi-generator"](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator). The api specification is located at [here](https://api.twitter.com/2/openapi.json) that is provided by Twitter, inc.

The purpose of this repository is to enable developers to set up Twitter API's client code, without deep understand about OpenAPI.

## Usege

```swift
import OpenTwitterAPI

let bearerToken = "xxx"
let userID = "xxxx"
OpenTwitterAPIClientAPI.customHeaders["Authorization"] = "Bearer \(bearerToken)"

Task {
    do {
        let userIDs = try await UsersAPI.usersIdFollowing(id: userID)
        print(userIDs)
    } catch {
        print("An error occur: \(error)")
    }
}

```

Please check out `Client/docs` for more details.

## Installation

CocoaPods and Carthage has not supported yet, so please use SwiftPackage for installing.

## Regenerate codes

I will use GitHub Action for automated re-generation of the client, but I kick it manually now.

Please setup Docker environment, and execute:

```
sh update.sh
```

## License

This repository basically follows [an OpenAPITools/openapi-genarator's license definition](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#table-of-contents), but if there are any problems, please let us know as issues.
